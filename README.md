This project is part of The Odin Project. 
The task is to write a program that lets you play "rock paper scissors".
The game will be played in the console.
 
 Step 1: Write logic to get computer choice:
 Math.random() outputs random number between 0 and 1
 Multiply output by thirty and round down to integer
 This outputs an integer between 1 and 30
 Return Rock if output between 1 and 10
 Return Paper if output between 11 and 20
 Return Scissors if output between 21 and 30

 Step 2: Write logic to get user choice:
 (Under the assumptiokn that the user input will always be one of the three choices.)
 Get user input through prompt()
 Return user input
